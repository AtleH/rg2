# Routegadget 2

## Latest news
Version 0.9.1 was released on 25 October 2014 and has been installed on all routegadget.co.uk sites. The two main changes are improvements in manager functionality.

* If you upload the map file as a GIF then this is kept, rather than being converted to a JPG file. This should allow much smaller map image files to be used. A JPG file is also stored for compatibility with RG1.
* Georeferencing information is now saved for each map. Georeferenced course files should now be aligned correctly each time you use the map, rather than just at the time you upload it.

## What is RouteGadget?
Routegadget is a Web application for drawing and comparing orienteering routes. The original version was developed by Jarkko Ryypp√∂, and it is now used by [orienteering clubs around the world] (http://www.routegadget.net). This includes a very big user base in [Great Britain] (http://www.routegadget.co.uk/).

## Why Routegadget 2?
The original Routegadget makes extensive use of Java, and this has caused increasing difficulties.
Routegadget 2 allows you to view existing Routegadget information in any modern (HTML5-compliant) browser without the need for Java. It also adds a modern user interface as well as updated functionality for analysis.
